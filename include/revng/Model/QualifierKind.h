  Enum for identifying different kinds of qualifiers

  Notice that we are choosing to represent pointers and arrays as qualifiers.
  The idea is that a qualifier is something that you can add to a type T to
  obtain another type R, in such a way that if T is fully known also R is fully
  known. In this sense Pointer and Array types are qualified types.
type: enum
members:
  - name: Pointer
  - name: Array
  - name: Const
