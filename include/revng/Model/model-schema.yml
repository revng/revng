      Data structure representing the whole binary.

      and more.

          A list of binaries used in this project. Currently only limited to 0
          or 1 elements.
          This is currently optional and a Model is valid without any Binaries
          specified. This is done as a transitional measure as the new
          experimental pipeline is implemented. Eventually this limitation will
          be lifted and each element of `Segments` will need to reference a
          binary present in `Binaries`.
          Do note that, even in this transitional phase, running some pipes in
          the new experimental pipeline will lead to an error being thrown if
          `Binaries` is empty.

        doc: |-
          A list of addresses known to contain code.
          rev.ng is usually able to discover all the code by itself by recursively
          visiting the control-flow graph of functions and the call graph.
          However, certain pieces of code cannot be identified through these
          techniques.
          A prime example are the addresses of `catch` blocks of C++ exception
          handlers: no code ever directly jumps there and their address is not
          stored in jump tables. Their address can only be obtained by interpreting
          metadata in the ELF.

      Base data structure for all the type definitions.

      A type definition differs from a `Type` in the fact that it has an identity.
      In fact, while two identical instances of `Type` can be considered to be the
      same `Type`, two instances of a `TypeDefinition` that only differ from their
      `ID` are two distinct types.

      A type definition can be a `struct`, a `union`, a `typedef`, an `enum` or a
      function prototype.

      This is an "high level" representation of the prototype of a function. It is

      information about the register is embedded. That information is implicit in
      the ABI this type is associated to.

      This is a "low level" representation of the prototype of a function. Where
      the list of registers used to pass arguments and return values is explicitl.
      For stack arguments, they are collected in a single `struct`
      (`StackArgumentsType`).

      In contrast, a `CABIFunctionDefinition` expresses the function type from a
      high-level perspective (e.g., a single argument might span multiple registers)
      and his associated to a well-known ABI. Given an ABI, it is always possible
      to convert a `CABIFunctionDefinition` into a `RawFunctionDefinition`.

          initial and final value of the stack pointer is 8.
