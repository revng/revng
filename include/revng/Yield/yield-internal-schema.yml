          This flag is set to `false` for basic blocks that are never directly
          pointed to, i.e. blocks that are only ever entered from the previous
          instructions and such.
          This lets us dynamically decide whether we want to show labels like this

          \note: This is always equal to `false` on architectures that do not
          support delay slots.

          Target of the CFG edge

          If invalid, it's an indirect edge such as a return instruction or an
          indirect function call.
          If valid, it's either the address of the basic block in case of a direct
          branch, or, in case of a function call, the address of the callee.
