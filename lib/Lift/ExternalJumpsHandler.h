/// \brief Inject code to support jumping in non-translated code and handling
///        the comeback.
///
/// This pass changes the default case of the dispatcher by checking if you're
/// trying to jump to an address that is not in one of the executable segments.
/// If so, the relevant a setjmp is performed, the CPU state is serialized to
/// the actual phsyical registers and then a jump to the target address is
/// performed. At this point the jump might be successful or it might fail.
///
/// Symmetrically, with the help of support.c, a signal handler is installed
/// which detects segmentation faults and checks if an attempt to jump to an
/// executable segment was performed.
/// If this is the case, we perform a longjmp to get back into the proper
/// context, we restore the relevant registers from the data structures provided
/// by the signal handler and then jump to the dispatcher to resume execution.
